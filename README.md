# [Twitter Profile Viewer](https://profileviewer.vercel.app)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About the migration to the new domain
I created this tool to apply for [Cloudflare's Developer Summer Challenge](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-summer-challenge/). I really enjoyed coding it, dealing with the Twitter API etc. It was really fun. However I don't want to renew its domain because I believe it's not necessary. So I decided to connect it to Vercel and use vercel.app subdomain. You can use the domain **profileviewer.site** until September 20. After that, I won't be owning the domain so you won't be able to access it through that domain.
